# Newton's Method Calculator
This calculator was created for [CS 108 final project at Calvin University](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/108/kvlinden/project/).

It can approximate the root of a differentiable function, to a desired precision, by using the [Newton’s Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Newton%27s_method&oldid=956131515), which is one of the most prominent root-finding algorithms.

Please make sure to install [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) libraries before running the module.

This calculator can support many different types of functions; however, it is unable to graph all of them due to incompatibilities with NumPy and their lack of support for certain mathematical functions [e.g. arccot(x)]. I would encourage users to limit to approximating monomial or polynomial functions for the best experience with the calculator. Please refer to the calculator’s documentation for more detail.
