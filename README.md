# Newton's Method Calculator
This project was created for CS108 final project at Calvin University.

This project is dependent on SymPy, NumPy, and matplotlib libraries.

My calculator can support many different types of functions; however, it is unable to graph all of them due to incompatibilities with NumPy and their lack of support for certain mathematical functions [e.g. arccot(x)]. I would encourage users to use monomial or polynomial functions for the best experience with the calculator.

My project can run on Windows system. I have not tested it on other OS.
