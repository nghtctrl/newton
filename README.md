# Newton's Method Calculator
This calculator was created for [CS 108 final project at Calvin University](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/108/kvlinden/project/).

Please make sure to install SymPy, NumPy, and matplotlib libraries before running the module.

This calculator can support many different types of functions; however, it is unable to graph all of them due to incompatibilities with NumPy and their lack of support for certain mathematical functions [e.g. arccot(x)]. I would encourage users to limit to approximating monomial or polynomial functions for the best experience with the calculator.
